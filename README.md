Hi, I'm Jeremiah Ddumba  

I design and implement high-performance digital hardware, from RTL to silicon.

Currently seeking **Sprting & Summer 2026 internships in Hardware Engineering & Technical Program Management**.


## What I Do
- **Hardware Verification:** ARM validation, UVM testbenches, formal verification
- **FPGA Design:** RISC-V cores, custom peripherals, timing closure
- **RF/SDR Systems:** Satellite receivers, radio telescope arrays
- **Technical Leadership:** Led 47-student radio telescope program ($29K), transformed IEEE from 4 members â†’ largest org on campus


I'm a hands-on hardware engineer who builds and verifies digital systems. Whether I'm closing timing on a RISC-V core, optimizing for power and area, or coordinating 47-person technical programs, I solve complex problems with curiosity and a bias toward action.

I fix bottlenecks, debug timing, and build what's missing.
